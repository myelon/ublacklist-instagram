# uBlacklist Anti-Instagram Filter List

This repository contains a filter list specifically tailored for the [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/uBlacklist) browser extension, with the goal of blocking Instagram-related domains from surfacing in search results. It's curated for those who desire a search experience free from Instagram domains (across platforms such as Google, Bing, Brave, and DuckDuckGo).

## Features
- **Obstructs primary Instagram domains and associated subdomains.**
- **Effortlessly integrates with the uBlacklist extension.**
- **Tailored and refined to block search results related to Instagram.**

## How to Use

1. **Install the uBlacklist Extension**:
   - For [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640)
   - For [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe)
   - For [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/)

2. **Subscribe to the Filter List**:
   - Open the uBlacklist settings within your browser.
   - Within "Subscription", select "Add Subscription".
   - Label the subscription appropriately (for instance, "Anti-Instagram List") and input the raw URL of the filter list from this repository.
   - Press "Add", and the extension will automatically subscribe to this list, keeping it updated over time.

3. Now, when you employ supported search engines, websites correlating to the filter list will be excluded from the results.

> **Note**: This list simply restricts certain domains from being shown in search results; it doesn't function as a content filter on web pages. Its primary purpose is to ensure a more streamlined search experience.
